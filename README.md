This project allowed me to exercise my ability to organize elements on a simple webpage. 
I made use of Developer Tools to see how the real Google homepage is constructed. 
I learned that it is good practice to make a navigation bar using an unordered list, and to make separate lists for different parts of the page.
I used different techniques to manipulate the organization of elements. 
This will be my first practical git push, and I know now that it would have been better practice to be pushing more often.
